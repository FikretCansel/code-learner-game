## Gameplay
Knightfall consists of a game where the player (knight) is placed in the in a board full of blocks and enemies, and must collect a key which will unlock the door that leads to the next level. The Knight himself can't be moved directly, but you can move him around by rotating the board and destroying blocks by clicking on them. You can only destroy blocks in groups of three or more.
